    "\n",
    "1. Partitioning Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: K-means, K-medoids.\n",
    "* Approach: These methods divide the dataset into a predefined number of clusters. They aim to minimize intra-cluster variance.\n",
    "* Assumptions: Assumes spherical clusters of similar size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hierarchical Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: Agglomerative and divisive clustering.\n",
    "* Approach: Builds a hierarchy of clusters either by merging smaller clusters (agglomerative) or splitting larger clusters (divisive).\n",
    "* Assumptions: No need to specify the number of clusters in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Density-Based Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: DBSCAN, OPTICS.\n",
    "* Approach: Clusters are formed based on the density of data points in a region. It can find arbitrarily shaped clusters.\n",
    "* Assumptions: Assumes clusters are dense regions separated by areas of lower density.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Model-Based Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).\n",
    "* Approach: Assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of several distributions. Clusters are represented by probability distributions.\n",
    "* Assumptions: Assumes that data points are generated from a mixture of underlying probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Grid-Based Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: STING, CLIQUE.\n",
    "* Approach: Divides the data space into a finite number of cells and performs clustering on these cells.\n",
