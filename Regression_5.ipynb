    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines the penalties of Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) methods. It aims to improve model accuracy and prevent overfitting by applying both L1 and L2 regularization simultaneously. This helps in situations where there are multiple features that are correlated.\n",
