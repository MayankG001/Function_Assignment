    "An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method that combines multiple models (often called \"base learners\") to produce a single, stronger model. The idea is that by aggregating the predictions of several models, the ensemble can achieve better performance than any individual model, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving accuracy."

    "Boosting is an ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners (models that perform slightly better than random chance) to create a strong learner. It works by training models sequentially, where each new model focuses on the errors made by the previous ones. The final prediction is made by combining the predictions of all models, often using a weighted average."
