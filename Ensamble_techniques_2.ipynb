    "Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregating, reduces overfitting in decision trees by creating multiple subsets of the training data through random sampling with replacement. Each subset is used to train a separate decision tree. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions (for regression) or voting (for classification) of all the trees. This process helps to smooth out the predictions and reduces the variance of the model, making it less sensitive to noise in the training data and thus less prone to overfitting."

    "A real-world application of bagging is in the field of finance for credit scoring. Financial institutions use bagging to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan. By training multiple decision trees on different subsets of historical loan data, the ensemble can provide a more accurate and robust prediction of credit risk. This helps in making informed lending decisions and reducing the risk of defaults."
