    "3. 'a' (Append Mode): Opens a file for appending. Data will be written at the end of the file without truncating it. If the file does not exist, it will be created.\n",
    "4. 'b' (Binary Mode): This mode can be added to other modes (e.g., 'rb', 'wb') to read or write binary files.\n",
    "5. 'x' (Exclusive Creation Mode): Opens a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation will fail.\n",
