    "The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces. As the number of dimensions increases, the volume of the space increases exponentially, making the available data sparse. This sparsity can lead to several issues, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increased computational cost: More dimensions require more data to maintain statistical significance.\n",
    "* Overfitting: Models may become overly complex and fit noise rather than the underlying data distribution.\n",
    "* Distance concentration: In high dimensions, the distance between points becomes less meaningful, making it difficult for algorithms that rely on distance metrics.\n",
